It details a machine learning study using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier on a dataset containing international football match results and predicting the matches of 2024 UEFA EURO tournament.

Problem Definition

This study aims to develop a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model using international football match results and predict the results of future matches using this model. Match results are placed in the category of winner, draw or loser determined by the goals scored by the home team and away team.

Purpose and Scope

The aim of this study is to create a classification model using international football match results and predict the results of 2024 UEFA European Football Championship group stages, knockout rounds, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final matches using this model. This study also aims to explain the methods, data pre-processing steps and results followed while developing the KNN model in detail.

Significance of the Study

This study is important to understand how machine learning algorithms can be used in sports predictions and what factors are important in predicting football match results. In addition, this study serves as a guide for researchers and sports analysts who want to learn how to apply the KNN algorithm and various performance metrics.
